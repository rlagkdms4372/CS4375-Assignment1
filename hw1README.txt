How to Run:
- I did write the same code about the preprocessing for both of part 1 and part 2
- you can run the part 1 and part 2 separately

- I attached py and ipynb(colab) because I write the code through 'colab'. So, I am not sure that the .py file
works well

Libraries
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.metrics, sklearn.model_selection)
- Matplotlib
- seaborn

If the data is failed to bring out, this is the dataset that I used for this project
Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG

Description:
- This homework is to write my one gradient descent and figure out the MSE of train and test dataset, and I apply same data 
to the linear regression model from scikit-learn and compare two results. My data is Auto-MPG and I set the mpg as a response
variable, and I deleted all the discrete values and continued thie project with only continuous attibutes.
